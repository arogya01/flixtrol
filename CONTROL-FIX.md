# 🔧 Forward/Backward Control Fix

## What Was Fixed

**Issue**: Forward (⏩) and Backward (⏪) controls were not working on Netflix.

**Root Cause**: Netflix uses a custom video player that doesn't respond well to direct `currentTime` manipulation. Netflix's player expects keyboard events (arrow keys) or needs additional event dispatching.

**Solution**: Implemented a **dual-method approach** for all controls:
1. **Primary Method**: Simulate keyboard shortcuts that Netflix's player natively responds to
2. **Backup Method**: Direct video element manipulation with proper event dispatching

---

## Technical Changes

### Enhanced All Controls with Keyboard Simulation

#### 1. **Forward Control (⏩)**
- **Primary**: Simulates `→` (Right Arrow) key press
- **Backup**: Sets `video.currentTime + 10` with events
- Netflix's native shortcut: Right arrow = skip forward 10s

#### 2. **Backward Control (⏪)**
- **Primary**: Simulates `←` (Left Arrow) key press
- **Backup**: Sets `video.currentTime - 10` with events
- Netflix's native shortcut: Left arrow = skip back 10s

#### 3. **Play/Pause Control (▶️/⏸️)** (Also improved)
- **Primary**: Simulates `Space` key press
- **Backup**: Direct `video.play()` / `video.pause()`
- Netflix's native shortcut: Space = toggle play/pause

#### 4. **Volume Up (🔊)** (Also improved)
- **Primary**: Simulates `↑` (Up Arrow) key press
- **Backup**: Sets `video.volume + 0.1`
- Netflix's native shortcut: Up arrow = increase volume

#### 5. **Volume Down (🔉)** (Also improved)
- **Primary**: Simulates `↓` (Down Arrow) key press
- **Backup**: Sets `video.volume - 0.1`
- Netflix's native shortcut: Down arrow = decrease volume

### New Helper Function

```javascript
function simulateKeyPress(key, keyCode) {
  const events = ['keydown', 'keypress', 'keyup'];
  events.forEach(eventType => {
    const event = new KeyboardEvent(eventType, {
      key: key,
      keyCode: keyCode,
      code: key,
      which: keyCode,
      bubbles: true,
      cancelable: true
    });
    document.dispatchEvent(event);
  });
}
```

This simulates real keyboard input that Netflix's player recognizes and responds to.

## How to Test

### Step 1: Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find **Flixtrol**
3. Click the **reload icon** ↻
4. ✅ Extension reloaded with fixes

### Step 2: Test on Netflix
1. **Open Netflix** (netflix.com)
2. **Play any video** (movie or show)
3. **Open a new tab** (any website)
4. **Click Flixtrol icon** to show control panel
5. ✅ Panel appears with green "Netflix Connected" indicator

### Step 3: Test Forward Control
1. Note the current timestamp in the video
2. **Click ⏩ button** (Forward)
3. ✅ Video should skip forward ~10 seconds
4. Click it again
5. ✅ Another 10 second skip forward
6. You should see Netflix's on-screen indicator appear

### Step 4: Test Backward Control
1. Note the current timestamp
2. **Click ⏪ button** (Backward)
3. ✅ Video should skip backward ~10 seconds
4. Click it again
5. ✅ Another 10 second skip backward
6. You should see Netflix's on-screen indicator appear

### Step 5: Test All Other Controls
1. **Play/Pause (▶️/⏸️)**: Click to pause → Click to play
2. **Volume Up (🔊)**: Click 2-3 times → Volume increases
3. **Volume Down (🔉)**: Click 2-3 times → Volume decreases

### Step 6: Rapid Testing
1. **Rapidly click** forward button 5 times
2. ✅ Video should skip ahead ~50 seconds total
3. **Rapidly click** backward button 3 times
4. ✅ Video should go back ~30 seconds

### Step 7: During Presentation
1. Keep Netflix playing in one tab
2. Join **Google Meet** in another tab
3. **Share your screen**
4. Press `Ctrl+Shift+N` (or `Cmd+Shift+N`)
5. Test all controls during screen share
6. ✅ All controls should work while presenting

---

## Expected Behavior

### Visual Feedback
When you click forward/backward, you should see:
- ✅ **Netflix's native on-screen indicator** appears (shows skip amount)
- ✅ **Video progress bar** updates
- ✅ **Timestamp** changes appropriately

### Performance
- ✅ Controls respond **immediately** (< 100ms)
- ✅ **No lag** or delay
- ✅ Works **during buffering**
- ✅ Works at **any point** in the video

## Debugging

### If Forward/Backward Still Don't Work

#### Check 1: Netflix Tab
- Make sure Netflix is actually **playing a video**
- URL must be `netflix.com/watch/...`
- Status indicator should be **green**

#### Check 2: Browser Console
1. Open Netflix tab
2. Press **F12** (DevTools)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Click forward/backward buttons
5. Look for:
   - ✅ `"Netflix controller loaded"` message
   - ❌ Any red errors

#### Check 3: Content Script Loaded
1. In Netflix tab DevTools (Console)
2. Type: `document.querySelector('video')`
3. Press Enter
4. ✅ Should show: `<video>` element
5. ❌ If `null`: Refresh Netflix page

#### Check 4: Manual Test
1. In Netflix tab, try pressing keyboard:
   - `→` (Right arrow) - should skip forward
   - `←` (Left arrow) - should skip backward
2. If these **don't work**, Netflix might be focused elsewhere
3. **Click on the video** first, then try controls

### Common Issues

**"Video not found" error**:
- Netflix page might not be fully loaded
- Refresh the Netflix tab
- Start playing the video again

**Controls work but no visual feedback**:
- This is actually fine! Video is still seeking
- Netflix sometimes hides the indicator
- Check the timestamp/progress bar

**Delayed response**:
- Normal for slower connections
- The keyboard simulation is instant
- Direct manipulation has 50ms delay as backup

## Technical Notes

### Why Keyboard Simulation?

Netflix's custom video player intercepts keyboard events for its controls. By simulating these keyboard events, we're using Netflix's own control system rather than fighting against it.

**Benefits**:
1. ✅ Works with Netflix's internal state management
2. ✅ Triggers Netflix's visual feedback
3. ✅ Respects Netflix's playback logic
4. ✅ Compatible with future Netflix updates
5. ✅ No timing/sync issues

### Dual-Method Approach

Both methods run for reliability:
1. **Keyboard simulation** (runs first): Uses Netflix's native controls
2. **Direct manipulation** (50ms later): Ensures the seek happens even if keyboard events are blocked

This redundancy ensures maximum compatibility.
