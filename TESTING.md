# ðŸ§ª Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed

**Issue**: The panel toggle wasn't working when clicking the extension icon.

**Root Cause**: The background script was re-injecting the content script on every click, and the control panel script would toggle but then return early, preventing the message listener from being set up properly.

**Solution**: 
1. Background script now tries to send a toggle message first
2. Only injects the script if the message fails (script not present)
3. Control panel script sets up once and listens for toggle messages

   - `"Panel toggled via message"` (subsequent clicks)
   - Any errors in red

### Common Issues

**Panel appears but won't toggle off**:

- Try refreshing the page and clicking icon again

**"No Netflix Tab Found"**:
